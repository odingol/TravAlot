## USER STORY

    AS A team of web developers
    WE WANT to create a REST API that acts as a travel planning website allowing users to view and save some of the top resorts, theme parks, water parks, and roller coasters
    SO THAT their personal profile page can be updated with some of the various locations they would like to visit in the future.

## DESCRIPTION
Our travel application is designed to present users with four different options for travel destinations like theme parks, water parks, resorts, and specialty rollercoasters. Each subsequent page displays the top five destinations/parks for each category that showcases information like the website, address, yearly visitors, and a brief description of the location. A Google Maps API shows pinpoints of each of the attractions so that the user can have additional visual feedback in understanding the exact location of their potential next travel destination. If a user chooses to create a profile for our page, they will have the option to save destination locations/general information to their profile page. Though the website functions normally without the need to log in, having a unique profile page allows the users to save their desired locations without having to dig through the other pages again.

## FUTUREDEVELOPMENTS
Some future developments that we would like to include with more time would be a reviews section where users can write and post reviews of their desired attraction that would be displayed to future users visiting the site. Another development we would like to include would be to expand the list of our attractions by an additional 10 to 15 destinations per page.

## CHALLENGES FACED

The main challenges faced in this project was coordinating with the front end and back end developers to ensure that proper routes and requests were correctly linked to display pages with database information that could be saved through session data and displayed on the users profile page. Another challenge faced was deciding what core elements we wanted to include and which elements could be shelved to be implemented at a later date with more time to develop.
